# Quake_Track
An Arduino &amp; Wave Shield based speaker that plays MP3s when it senses earthquake tremors 

The fact is, you never know when disaster is going to strike, be it illness, and accident, a crash in the stock market
or the Vancouver mega earthquake. Yet so many of us live in constant anxiety of what is around the corner and it prevents
us from enjoying the present. Quake Track is inspired by critical design and ludic design practices, design that aims to
go beyond ease and efficiency, and use functional objects to communicate ideas, possibilities and problems. It aims to 
bring joy through humor and surprise, and incite play and wonder. It also serves as a critic of futility of worrying about
things we cannot change or prevent.
My device is there to do the worrying and waiting for you, so you can seize the day while it awaits danger. 
Through the use of vibration sensors, an Arduino and a sleek simple speaker, the Quaketrack sits calmly on your mantle;
until it doesnâ€™t. When triggered, the Quake Track will blast one of 4 epic movie scores, sure to motivate and inspire in 
times of crisis. The track will play as long as vibrations are sensed, and will pause and play with the earthquake movement
Vibrations occuring more than 10 minutes apart will prompt a new song to play.
